\section{Introduction}
The application “ DONOR AND RECEIVER ” connects the needy people and the donor in a quicker way.  The application aims at bringing the donors and the recipients in close contact so that needy people can receive what exactly they need easily. Currently the recipients have to sometime invest in money to advertise that cause wastage of time and resources.
This application will help find material donors easily. Donors can register to know about the urgent needs and donation location nearest to them. Charity Organizations like churches and schools or any recognized group in need of a material can also register and find donors in their specified area.
It is software developed for devices running on android platform version 4.2 and above where charities can look for donors in their nearby area who will be available in quick time.
